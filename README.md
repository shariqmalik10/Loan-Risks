# Loan-Risks

## 1. Introduction 
This project was done as part of a take home assignment where I had to analyse data and create a machine learning model to predict whether, given for a specific entry, the applicant would repay his loan in full or default. 

## 2. Results
The machine learning model was built successfully with a accuracy of 93.07%. The data analysis done is available in the 'notebooks' folder of this repo in the notebook named 'lightgbm_build.ipynb'
