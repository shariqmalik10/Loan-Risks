    "# Introduction and Documentation for the Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to build a machine learning pipeline that will automate the process of retraining and fine-tuning the model every time we recieve new data\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture for this pipeline has been divided into 6 sections: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Ingestion \n",
    "2. Data Preprocessing \n",
    "3. Feature Engineering\n",
    "4. Model Training\n",
    "5. Model Evaluation \n",
    "6. Model Deployment (not implemented in this project)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline Designing \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially I was looking into complex ML pipeline architectures such as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) as well as Single Leader Architecture but after reviewing the problem a few more times from the given question paper as well as the initial model that has been built in the 'lightgbm_build.ipynb' file, I realized that a simpler workflow would be much more suitable while also borrowing some concepts from DAG architecture. The next section is to show the initial and final draft for the pipeline design that I worked on\n",
    "\n",
    "## Drafts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Draft Image \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/initial_draft.jpg\" alt=\"Initial Draft Image\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Draft Image \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/final_draft.jpg\" alt=\"Final Draft Image\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion \n",
    "\n",
    "From the diagrams above, it can be observed that not much changed between my initial idea and the final design. The final draft image gives a high level overview of all the processes that happen within each step. To keep it simple I did not add any descriptions in the diagram as all the explanations and reasoning has been mentioned in the notebook along with the corresponding step. The pipeline overall, has been kept simple and designed in a way which allows for additional components as well as other pre-processing steps. Comments have been added at each important line of code in order to aid understanding of what the code is doing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I have referred to the 'lightgbm_build.ipynb' as while working on that model I had already planned most of the steps that I needed to carry out for my pipeline. While designing the pipeline I needed to make some adjustments and change the placement of a few pre-processing steps that were carried out. Instead of saving the model in the final steps, I saved the pipeline."

So the improvement to make here would be to later on add in a few more pre-procesing steps that can impute data for other features that may not have entries within them \n",
